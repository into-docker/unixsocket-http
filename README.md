**unixsocket-http** is a Clojure library to handle HTTP communication over
UNIX domain sockets. This kind of I/O is notably used by the [Docker][docker]
daemon which was the main driver to create this library.

[docker]: https://www.docker.com/

## Usage

Use the `unixsocket-http.core` namespace to access HTTP functionality with
a similar API as [clj-http][].

```clojure
(require '[unixsocket-http.core :as uhttp])
(def client (uhttp/client "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"))
```

To provide a common API towards TCP sockets, they are also supported:

```clojure
(def client (uhttp/client "tcp://127.0.0.1:6537"))
```

Note that this project does not have the ambition to replicate all of clj-http's
functionality. The main use case is communication with Docker which will
naturally restrict the feature set implemented.

Once you have a client, you can send requests:

```clojure
(uhttp/get client "/_ping")
;; {:status 200,
;;  :headers
;;  {"api-version" "1.40",
;;   "server" "Docker/19.03.2 (linux)",
;;   "content-type" "text/plain; charset=utf-8",
;;   "content-length" "2",
;;   "docker-experimental" "false",
;;   "pragma" "no-cache",
;;   "date" "Thu, 09 Apr 2020 15:20:06 GMT",
;;   "ostype" "linux",
;;   "cache-control" "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"},
;;  :body "OK"}
```

All HTTP functions take an options map as their last parameter that can be used
to supply additional data or alter the request/response behaviour.

### Query Parameters & Body

Query parameters can be passed using `:query-params`, and a body can be
supplied as either `InputStream` or `String` using the `:body` key.

```clojure
(uhttp/post
  client
  "/images/create"
  {:query-params {:fromImage "node:alpine", :repo "testnode", :tag "latest"}})
;; {:status 200,
;;  :headers
;;  {"api-version" "1.40",
;;   "content-type" "application/json",
;;   "date" "Thu, 09 Apr 2020 15:27:11 GMT",
;;   "docker-experimental" "false",
;;   "ostype" "linux",
;;   "server" "Docker/19.03.2 (linux)",
;;   "transfer-encoding" "chunked"},
;;  :body
;;  "{\"status\":\"Pulling from library/node\",\"id\":\"latest\"}\r\n..."}
```

### Streaming Responses

Use `:as :stream` in the options map to make `:body` an `java.io.InputStream` to
consume from. Alternatively, use `:as :socket` to get access to the underlying
`java.net.Socket` for bidirectional communication.

Always make sure to call `close` on the resources obtained this way, otherwise
you'll run into connection leaks.

### Exceptions

By default, HTTP status codes â‰¥ 400 will cause an exception
(`clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo`) to be thrown. You can access the underlying
response via `ex-data`.

Note that the `:body` will not be present if you are expecting a streaming
response, unless you explicitly set `:throw-entire-message?` to `true`.

If you want to prevent the client from throwing exceptions, and you'd rather get
the response no matter what, you can set `:throw-exceptions?` to `false`.

### TLS

You can create a client with an `https://...` URL, which will prompt it to use
TLS to perform any requests. Usually, the relevant certificates should be
present in your Java keystore and the underlying `OkHttpClient` will pick them
up automatically when verifying the connection.

For _mutual_ TLS (mTLS) or pointers on how to tackle TLS setup manually, check
out the [respective documentation](./doc/01-mTLS.md).

## GraalVM

This library can be used with GraalVM's [`native-image`][native-image] tool to
create native Clojure executables. The necessary configuration files are already
bundled with this library and should be picked up automatically.
